# Installation Reference

Got a new machine? Tired of reading medium articles or sifting through all the latest and greatest plugins that sort-of work?

Same, so I decided to create this repo to help me when I inevitably have to set up a new machine for work/pleasure. I put this together for my personal development needs with the languages that I commonly use. There is a lot more that can be done here, but hopefully this helps someone do what I just did and saves them a few hours.

This was done quickly with the help of Claude 3.5 Sonnet, so if there are any errors, take it up with Anthropic.

Neovim configs coming soon.

This document provides a list of all tools and applications installed by the setup script, along with their descriptions and official website links.
