# Installation Reference

Got a new machine? Tired of reading medium articles or sifting through all the latest and greatest plugins that sort-of work?

Same, so I decided to create this repo to help me when I inevitably have to set up a new machine for work/pleasure. I put this together for my personal development needs with the languages that I commonly use. There is a lot more that can be done here, but hopefully this helps someone do what I just did and saves them a few hours.

This script automates the setup of a development environment on macOS. It installs and configures a variety of tools and applications commonly used by developers + myself. This was done quickly with the help of Claude 3.5 Sonnet, so if there are any errors, take it up with Anthropic.

Neovim configs coming soon.

This document provides a list of all tools and applications installed by the setup script, along with their descriptions and official website links.

## Prerequisites

- macOS (tested on macOS Sonoma, but should work on recent versions)
- Internet connection

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/milancr/init_machine.git
   cd init_machine
   ```

2. Make the script executable:

   ```bash
   chmod +x init_machine.sh
   ```

3. Run the script:

   ```bash
   ./init_machine.sh
   ```

## Usage

The script is interactive and will prompt you for input at various stages. You can choose which components to install.

### Dry Run

To see what the script would do without making any changes to your system, use the `--dry-run` flag:
